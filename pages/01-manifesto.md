##What is POC?
POC is an **Output Caching framework** written **for PHP**.

##Why would you use POC?
 - Because it **saves** you **time** and **money... A LOT**!
 - It adds extra **protection** to your application.
 - It **enhances the performance** of your software.
 - It's built on the shoulders of giants by using mature **open source components**.
 - It uses the latest **inventions** of the PHP ecosystem.
 - It solves complex problems in an **easy** way.
 - It's **Cloud** ready.
 - It **enhances** your application's **SEO** value.
 - POC makes your software **robust** and gains the **high availability** of your software. 
 - POC is **open source**.

##POC is for Developers
 - The system is **compatible** with all your applications that support PHP 5.3 or above.
 - POC provides an **easy to use tool** to **solve performance problems**.
 - It makes cache implementation as **flexible** as possible.
 - **POC** is **"hot pluggable"** to any system. Applying it to existing projects requires minimal (in most cases only one line) modification of your existing code. 
 - It can be **easily turned on/off**.
 - Installation and basic setup can be done **in 5 minutes.**
 - Caching should **not make your code more complex**, and this process can be **transparent**.
 - We made it **scalable** to be able to run from a **single machine** configuration to any **complex webfarms**.
 - We built it on **Symfony2 components** to **increase** the projects **stability** and **decrease** its **complexity**.
 - **Easy** and custom **configuration** that meets your needs.
 - It is **continously integrated**!
 - **Does not hurt your current logic and **existing **infrastructure**, so you don't have to rewrite anything in your code, neither buy new hardware.
 - POC is **plugin** based.


##POC is for the business
 - Implementing a good caching solution for you site is **crucial for performance** but it can take a lot of development time. This software helps you reduce this time significantly.
 - The **fast**er your **site** the **higher search engine ranking it gets**.
 - POC helps you reduce the hardware needed to run your web applications and **saves you money**.

##POC is for free
 - POC is licensed under **Apache 2.0** license.
 - Anyone can modify and even sell it without the author's approval.

##POC is for the environment
 - As more and more PHP servers operate in the world proper **caching becomes** more **important** because it can **save energy** and **reduce waste**.
 - POC uses way **less resources than** a database backed **PHP page generation** in real time so you not only save time but you **save the resources of the planet** as well by using proper caching.

##What POC is not?
POC is **not a silver bullet for all your PHP performance problems**, but the second best thing to it.
